5. Click **"Run"** or **"Install and Run"**

### Step 2: Generate Code from Your Design
1. In Figma, **select the frame/component** you want to convert
2. The plugin should open automatically (or run it again from Plugins menu)
3. Choose your output format:
   - **HTML + Tailwind** (for web/React)
   - **Flutter** (for mobile)
   - **SwiftUI** (for iOS)
4. Click **"Generate Code"**
5. **Copy the generated code**

### Step 3: Share with Me in Cursor
1. Come back to Cursor
2. Paste the code and tell me:
   ```
   "I generated this code from Figma using the plugin:
   [paste code here]
   
   Can you help me integrate this into my project?"
   ```
3. Also share your Figma file link (make it viewable/public)

## Alternative: Manual Method (If Plugin Doesn't Work)

### Step 1: Export Assets
1. In Figma, **right-click** on any image/icon
2. Click **"Export"**
3. Choose **PNG** (2x) for images or **SVG** for icons
4. Save to a folder
5. Repeat for all images/icons you need

### Step 2: Get Design Specs
1. **For Colors:**
   - Click on any colored element
   - Look at the right panel → Copy the hex code (like #3b82f6)

2. **For Fonts:**
   - Click on any text
   - Right panel shows: Font name, size, weight
   - Write it down (e.g., "Inter, 32px, Bold")

3. **For Spacing:**
   - Hold **Option** (Mac) or **Alt** (Windows)
   - Hover between elements to see distances
   - Write down the spacing values

### Step 3: Share Everything
1. Share your Figma file link (make it public/viewable)
2. OR take screenshots of each section
3. Tell me the design specs:
   ```
   "Here's my Figma design:
   - Colors: Primary #3b82f6, Background #ffffff
   - Fonts: Inter, 32px for headings
   - Spacing: 80px between sections
   
   [paste Figma link or attach screenshots]"
   ```
